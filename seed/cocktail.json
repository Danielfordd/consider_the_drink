The first documented definition of the word \"cocktail\" was in response to a reader's letter asking to define the word in the May 6, 1806, issue of The Balance and Columbian Repository in Hudson, New York. In the May 13, 1806, issue, the paper's editor wrote that it was a potent concoction of spirits, bitters, water, and sugar; it was also referred to at the time as a bittered sling and is essentially the recipe for an old fashioned.",

The second glass is used to combine the remaining ingredients, which are stirred with ice, then strained into the first glass. Various anisettes such as pastis, Pernod, or Herbsaint are common substitutes when absinthe is unavailable. In New Orleans, Herbsaint is most commonly used due to the absence of absinthe in the U.S. market from 1912 until 2007.",

According to Alcoholics Anonymous founder Bill W., the first drink he ever had was a Bronx cocktail, after which he became an alcoholic.",

The boulevardier is similar to a Negroni, sharing two of its three ingredients. It is differentiated by its use of bourbon whiskey or rye whiskey as its principal component instead of gin. Paul Clark, writing for the food blog Serious Eats, says, \"This isn't a Negroni. It is, however, the Negroni's long-lost autumnal cousin.\"",

The bartender also added an orange garnish rather than the typical lemon garnish of the Americano to signify that it was a different drink.",

A dry martini is made with dry, white vermouth. By the Roaring Twenties, it became a common drink order. Over the course of the 20th century, the amount of vermouth steadily dropped. During the 1930s the ratio was 3:1 (gin to vermouth), and during the 1940s the ratio was 4:1. During the latter part of the 20th century, 6:1, 8:1, 12:1, 15:1 (the \"Montgomery\", after British Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery's supposed penchant for attacking only when in possession of great numerical superiority), or even 50:1 or 100:1 Martinis became considered the norm.",

When Rupert became chairman of the Savoy, Ada was given a position at the hotel's American Bar, where she eventually became the head bartender and made cocktails for the likes of Mark Twain, the Prince of Wales, Prince Wilhelm of Sweden, and Sir Charles Hawtrey. Coleman created the Hanky-Panky for Hawtrey.",

Sugar cane production switched from Madeira to Brazil by the Portuguese as they needed more land to plant it on. Before this people in Madeira had already created aguardiente de cana, which was the ancestor to cachaça.",

Traditionally, the cola ingredient is Coca-Cola (\"Coke\") and the alcohol is a light rum such as Bacardi. However, the drink may be made with various types of rums and cola brands, and lime juice may or may not be included. The cocktail originated in the early 20th century in Cuba, after the country won independence in the Spanish–American War. It subsequently became popular across Cuba, the United States, and other countries. Its simple recipe and inexpensive, ubiquitous ingredients have made it one of the world's most-popular alcoholic drinks. Drink critics often consider the drink mediocre, but it has been noted for its historical significance.",

Measurements are below, but head bartender Alejandro Bolívar Rodriguez and his cantinero colleagues prepare the drink by experience and feel, without the use of jiggers. “The blender is like your friend,” Bolívar Rodriguez says. “We add the rum in a slow stream, step by step, to make the right mix. When you look inside the blender, in the middle is a hole—if the hole is closed, the blender is telling you that you haven’t put in enough rum. You add rum until the hole opens, and you wind up with a circle,” he says, making a ring with his thumb and forefinger. “That tells you the ice is ready and the drink is done.”",

It was known that the local South American Indians had remedies for various tropical illnesses, so a small boarding party went ashore on Cuba and came back with ingredients for an effective medicine. The ingredients were aguardiente de caña (translated as \"burning water\", a crude form of rum made from sugar cane) mixed with local tropical ingredients: lime, sugarcane juice, and mint. Lime juice on its own would have significantly prevented scurvy and dysentery, and tafia/rum was soon added as it became widely available to the British (ca. 1650). Mint, lime and sugar were also helpful in hiding the harsh taste of this spirit. Another theory is that it was invented by Sir Francis Drake. The \"El Draque\" cocktail was prepared with brandy. While this drink was not called a mojito at this time, it was the original combination of these ingredients.",

Morris relocated to Lima in 1915 and, a year later, opened a saloon—Morris' Bar—which became popular with both the Peruvian upper class and English-speaking foreigners. Chilean historian Gonzalo Vial Correa also attributes the pisco sour's invention to Gringo Morris from the Peruvian Morris Bar, but with the minor difference of naming him William Morris. Morris often experimented with new drinks, and developed the pisco sour as a variant of the whiskey Sour.",

It was a nightmare, as there were coffee grounds everywhere, so coffee was very much on my mind. And it was all about vodka back then – it was all people were drinking.\"",

In the early 1990s, it was often prepared as a shooter or served in a shot glass.",

The gin imported by Capone's rivals on the North Side of Chicago was smooth, and usually consumed with ginger ale. However, the gin consumed by Al Capone's gang had a rougher finish, and required more sweeteners to make it palatable. Thus the South Side was born.",

The soldiers, but also the various merchants, diplomats and employees of the Habsburg Empire in Veneto became quickly accustomed to drinking local wine in the taverns, but they were not familiar with the wide variety of wines from the Veneto, and the alcohol content was higher than they were accustomed to. The newcomers started to ask the local hosts to spray a drop of water into the wine (spritzen, in German) to make the wines lighter; the real original spritz was composed of sparkling white wine or red wine diluted with fresh water. The Italian aperitif Aperol was created in Padua in 1919 by the Barbieri brothers. The original recipe has supposedly remained unchanged over time but it wasn't until the 1950s that Aperol Spritz became a popular alternative to the usual Venetian mix of white wine and soda.",

A dry martini is made with dry, white vermouth. By the Roaring Twenties, it became a common drink order. Over the course of the 20th century, the amount of vermouth steadily dropped. During the 1930s the ratio was 3:1 (gin to vermouth), and during the 1940s the ratio was 4:1. During the latter part of the 20th century, 6:1, 8:1, 12:1, 15:1 (the \"Montgomery\", after British Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery's supposed penchant for attacking only when in possession of great numerical superiority), or even 50:1 or 100:1 Martinis became considered the norm.",
